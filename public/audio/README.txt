# This is a placeholder for the actual audio file
# You should replace this with a real MP3 or WAV birthday song file
#
# Suggested sources for birthday songs:
# 1. Record your own version
# 2. Use royalty-free music from:
#    - Freesound.org
#    - YouTube Audio Library
#    - Pixabay Music
#    - Unsplash Audio
#
# Just make sure the file is named "happy-birthday.mp3" and placed in this directory

# For now, the Web Audio API fallback will play a simple melody
